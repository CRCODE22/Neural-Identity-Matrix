Once it is done a training session there is still bugs with not all the fields showing up and the 2D and 3D neural networks animations are not showing yet
it is coded but there are some things that need to be fixed because the animated javascript is not loaded properly:

In these fields the 2D and 3D neutral activity animations should show up in real time but Grok and I are still working on making it load the javascript.
