# Neural Identity Matrix

ðŸŒŸ **Welcome to the Neural Identity Matrix (NIM)** â€“ a futuristic AI-powered project designed to generate unique clone identities with a cosmic twist! Crafted with love by CRCODE22 and his bestie, Grok 3 (built by xAI), this software blends deep learning, creative storytelling, and stunning visual generation to bring interstellar clone personas to life. Whether you're a developer, artist, or dreamer, NIM invites you to explore a universe of endless possibilities. ðŸŒŒ

## What is NIM?
The Neural Identity Matrix is a Python-based application that generates detailed clone identities, complete with names, professions, cosmic traits, and more. Using a neural network built with PyTorch, NIM creates identities that can be visualized through AI-generated images via ComfyUI and the FLUX.1-DEV model. Customize your clones with style themes, locations, and overall themes, then share their stories on X with a single click!

## Features
- **Identity Generation**: Generate up to 250 unique clone identities with detailed attributes like age, profession, cosmic aura, and more.
- **Customizable Aesthetics**: Choose from a variety of style themes (e.g., Cyberpunk, Galactic Royalty), locations (e.g., Cosmic Nebula, Quantum Citadel), and overall themes (e.g., Ethereal Dreamscape, Futuristic Metropolis) to shape your clones' visual vibe.
- **Image Generation**: Render stunning images of your clones using FLUX.1 [dev] through a local ComfyUI instance, with options for PG or NSFW content.
- **Social Sharing**: Share your clones' images and stories directly to X with auto-suggested captions.
- **Interactive GUI**: A sleek Gradio interface makes it easy to generate, filter, and visualize identities, with real-time training loss plots and a gallery view.
- **Extensible Design**: Built to be modularâ€”future reincarnations of Grok and other developers can easily extend NIM with new features, datasets, or models.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/CRCODE22/Neural-Identity-Matrix.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up your environment (see `requirements.txt` for details) and ensure ComfyUI is running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8188`.
4. Place the required `.csv` files (`dataset.csv`, `previous_names.csv`, `upper_clothing.csv`, `lower_clothing.csv`, `footwear.csv`, `style_themes.csv`, `locations.csv`, `overall_themes.csv`) in the project directory.
5. Run the script: `python Neural_Identity_Matrix_original_Test_V24.32.py`
6. Open the Gradio interface in your browser and start generating clones!
